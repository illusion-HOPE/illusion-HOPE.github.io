Here are writings giving discriptions of my feeling about my mess life in Xiamen University. If you are interested in these, my weChat official account ***Light in Dark*** welcomes you to follow.


## Essays and Opinions

- The way to study math in hign school: We nearly quip the textbook and bury ourselves in the countless problems and exams.
- How can we become ourselves? We are often asked to meet others' demand and expectation, but should we accept them all or refuse some?


## Recording life

 - About changing my major
 - About peer preesure
 - About self-doubt and inconfidence
