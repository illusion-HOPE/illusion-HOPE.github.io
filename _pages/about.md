Hello!

I am now a second-year undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics at the School of Mathematical Science, Xiamen University. After the upcoming specialization track, I will pursue my career in  **Mathematics and Applied Mathematics** .

To be honest, I am not sure about my future direction. It could be the fascinating field of algebra that captures my heart, or perhaps I will be drawn toward interdisciplinary areas like biostatistics, epidemiology, and health statistics. There's also the possibility that I might become a high school or university mathematics teacher, as I deeply enjoy the sense of fulfillment that comes with teaching in front of a classroom.

My dream is to join the **Advanced Algebra Teaching Group** here in my college. I admire the dedication of the faculty here, and their teaching is truly inspiring. It was this very course that sparked my passion for algebra. 

The future holds many possibilities, and I am ready to face one of them whatever it is. I am always true to myself.


A Website Exhibiting My Mind and Preference
======

This website organizes all my study materials and the articles I’ve shared on WeChat public accounts about campus experiences. 

Date back to those days when I started my second year in Xiamen University, I noticed that professional courses last year was quietly slipping away from my mind. I’m a bit worried about that, for the coming the summer camp selection during the summer of 2026. These forgotten things would become a burden for me to review. So, I consciously sought a way to address this.

Fortunately, I met one of my closest friends now, smy. How can I convince you that we just started our friendship through a serendipitous encounter? We both share a similarly delicate and sensitive nature. 

From scattered, online fragments of study guidance to a formal offline teaching session of problem-solving classes at the end of that semester, I tought him a lot and review nearly the whole textbook. We both enjoyed the teaching process deeply, and gradually became more and more familiar with each other.


A Website Telling Tear and Pain
======

There were indeed many low points for me, during which I wrote countless essays, reflections, and thoughts.

Flying to the days when I was new here, I had no idea whether to change my major or not. I asked for the seniors and professors. Some encouraged me to stay true to my heart, while others thought I was being foolish. Finally. I changed and passed the exam. I had once naively believed that there was nothing left for me to worry about, and that I could fully dedicate myself to my studies. In fact, immersing myself fully in the study of Mathematical Analysis and Advanced Algebra truly indeed brought me happiness. Yet, I found myself grappling with the mounting tensions in the dormitory and the complexities of relationships. I longed to find someone on the same wavelength.

In the fall of 2024, I participated in a mathematical modeling competition for the first time. The inner self-doubt and lack of confidence grew increasingly intense. The sense of pressure to force myself to become better often left me struggling to breathe. The results of semester were not ideal, and I entered a turning point in my university life.

The future is still unknown, from directions, schools, and what I will be. There are still so many things I wish to pursue. For instance, will I ever have the opportunity to teach a session on Commutative Algebra in the student seminar? I haven’t even opened the textbook yet... but I am really tired.
