I am currently a second-year undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics at the School of Mathematical Science, Xiamen University. After the upcoming specialization track, I may choose to pursue either the Mathematics or Applied Mathematics program.

To be honest, I am somewhat uncertain about my future direction. It could be the fascinating field of algebra that captures my heart, or perhaps I will be drawn toward interdisciplinary areas like biostatistics, epidemiology, and health statistics. There's also the possibility that I might become a high school or university mathematics teacher, as I deeply enjoy the sense of fulfillment that comes with teaching in front of a classroom.

My dream is to join the Advanced Algebra Teaching Group at the School of Mathematical Science, Xiamen University. I admire the dedication of the faculty here, and their teaching is truly inspiring. It was this very course that sparked my passion for algebra. 

The future holds many possibilities, and I am ready to face one of them whatever it is. I am always true to myself.


A Website Dedicated to Sharing My Daily Learning Resources
======

This website organizes all my study materials and the articles Iâ€™ve shared on WeChat public accounts about campus experiences. 

During the first semester of my sophomore year, I began to feel that I was gradually forgetting the professional courses I had studied in my freshman year. So, I consciously sought a way to address this. Fortunately, I met one of my closest friends now, SMY, through a serendipitous encounter. We both share a similarly delicate and sensitive nature. From scattered, online fragments of study guidance to a formal offline teaching session of problem-solving classes at the end of that semester, we embarked on this teaching journey together.

In the process of preparing and teaching, I not only reviewed all the knowledge I had learned but also gained a deeper understanding of it. Perhaps this is what is meant by "teaching and learning go hand in hand."
