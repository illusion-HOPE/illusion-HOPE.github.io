I am currently a second-year undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics at the School of Mathematical Science, Xiamen University. After the upcoming specialization track, I may choose to pursue either the Mathematics or Applied Mathematics program.

To be honest, I am not sure about my future direction. It could be the fascinating field of algebra that captures my heart, or perhaps I will be drawn toward interdisciplinary areas like biostatistics, epidemiology, and health statistics. There's also the possibility that I might become a high school or university mathematics teacher, as I deeply enjoy the sense of fulfillment that comes with teaching in front of a classroom.

My dream is to join the Advanced Algebra Teaching Group at the School of Mathematical Science, Xiamen University. I admire the dedication of the faculty here, and their teaching is truly inspiring. It was this very course that sparked my passion for algebra. 

The future holds many possibilities, and I am ready to face one of them whatever it is. I am always true to myself.


A Website Dedicated to Sharing My Daily Learning Resources

This website organizes all my study materials and the articles I’ve shared on WeChat public accounts about campus experiences. 

Date back to those days when I started my second year in Xiamen University, I noticed that professional courses last year was quietly slipping away from my mind. I’m a bit worried about that, for the coming the summer camp selection during the summer of 2026. These forgotten things would become a burden for me to review. So, I consciously sought a way to address this. Fortunately, I met one of my closest friends now, smy. How can I convince you that we just started our friendship through a serendipitous encounter? We both share a similarly delicate and sensitive nature. From scattered, online fragments of study guidance to a formal offline teaching session of problem-solving classes at the end of that semester, I tought him a lot and review nearly the whole textbook. We both enjoyed the teaching process deeply, and gradually became more and more familiar with each other.

In the process of preparing and teaching, I also gained a deeper understanding of what I have learnt. Perhaps this is what is meant by "teaching and learning go hand in hand."
