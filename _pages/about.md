Hello!

I am now a second-year undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics at the School of Mathematical Science, Xiamen University. After the upcoming specialization track, I will pursue my career in  **Mathematics and Applied Mathematics**.

To be honest, I am not sure about my future direction. It could be the fascinating field of **algebra** that captures my heart, or perhaps I will be drawn toward interdisciplinary areas like **biostatistics, epidemiology and health statistics**. There's also the possibility that I might become a high school **teacher** or university mathematics **professor**, <font color="darkgreen">as I deeply enjoy the sense of fulfillment that comes with teaching in front of a classroom.</font>

My dream is to join the **Advanced Algebra Teaching Group** here in my college. I admire the dedication of the faculty here, and their teaching is truly inspiring. It was this very course that sparked my passion for algebra. 

The future holds many possibilities, and I am ready to face one of them whatever it is. I am always true to myself.


## A Website Exhibiting My Mind and Preference


Date back to those days when I started my second year in Xiamen University, I noticed that professional courses learnt was quietly slipping away from my mind. I’m a bit worried about that, for the coming the summer camp in the summer of 2026. These forgotten knowledge would become a **BURDEN** for me to review. I consciously sought a way to address this.

Fortunately, I met one of my closest friends now, smy. How can I convince you that we just started our friendship through a serendipitous encounter? We both share a similarly delicate and sensitive nature. 

From online fragments of study guidance to **formal offline discussion sessions**, I tought him a lot and reviewed nearly the whole textbook. We both enjoyed the teaching process deeply, and gradually became more and more familiar with each other.


## A Website Telling Tear and Pain


There were indeed many low points for me, during which I wrote countless reflections, and thoughts.

Flying to the days when I was new here, I had no idea whether to change my major or not. I asked for the seniors and professors. Some encouraged me to stay true to my heart, while others thought I was being foolish. 

When I made it, I had once naively believed that there was nothing left for me to worry about, and that I could fully dedicate myself to my studies. In fact, I indeed **learnt HARDER than before** and gained happiness from it. At the meantime, I found the tensions with my roommates **exponentially** increasing, and the interpersonal relationships around me becoming more tricky. I longed to find someone on the same wavelength.

In the fall of 2024, I participated in a mathematical modeling competition for the first time. I won the first prize in my province, but I felt like it was still not good enough. **The inner self-doubt and lack of confidence** grew increasingly intense. The sense of pressure to force myself to become better often left me struggling to breathe. The final grades in this autumn semester are not satisfying, even though I was already very tired. And, I entered a turning point in my university life.

The future is still unknown, the directions, dreaming schools, and what I will be. There are still so many things I wish to pursue. Like will I be capable of teaching a session on **Commutative Algebra** in the student seminar? I haven’t even opened the textbook yet...
